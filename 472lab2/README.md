Reflective Analysis 

Hello Everyone! 
If you’re looking to visit some low-cost attractions at UBC, this map is certainty for you! https://ubc-geob472-spring2020.github.io/urveek-web/tourist-attractions_UBC.html

Audience and Intention 
My map is particularly intended for new UBC students and tourists looking to visit attractions at UBC. I specifically decide to portray low-cost attractions, to grab the attention of students, especially those living on or near campus. This map will benefit these students the most, as these attractions will be near the students. Given that students are very busy with coursework, quickly opening up a map to plan a Saturday outing will save these students a lot of time, thus making it more likely for them to take a break and visit these attractions. Being sensitive to the fact that several students are on a budget and that many student jobs start at minimum wage, I decided to specifically display low cost attractions on the map. 

Map Design 
I chose the ‘streets’ basemap when styling my map, as this is what most people are familiar with. I also wanted something simple to follow a visual hierarchy, to ensure that the most important part of the map (the attractions) stood out. I lightened all the background elements on the map (Canada and its provinces, the ocean and other land cover), to ensure that the contrast brings out these attractions and the pop-up information attached to it. I added the element motion to guide the reader from the Canadian to UBC’s context. The element of motion adds excitement and anticipation, which helps keeps the user engaged in the map from the get-go. This makes it more likely for them to use the map. I chose to map the map fly slowly to UBC in order to allow newcomers to Canada to familiarise themselves with the context. Once the map zooms into UBC the user immediately sees the attractions, which are represented by icons. I used icons rather than generic points to allow the user to quickly see what the attractions are without clicking on the pop-up. Using ‘style display’, I also ensure that the introductory button disappears once the map begins zooming into UBC and that the title only appears after the introductory button is clicked to maintain the visual hierarchy. 

Critique session. 
At first, my map mostly displayed outdoor attractions. In my critique session, my friend suggested that I balance indoor and outdoor attractions on the map, given that it rains a lot in Vancouver. I’m glad that I could receive such great feedback, as context is crucial in grabbing the attention of the audience. She also suggested that I give a geographical context of Canada, before diving into the map of UBC, as my map is also intended for tourists. Thus, the map may possibly act as a guided UBC tourism journey for tourists who have never been to UBC or even Canada. In taking her advice, I use the fly function to first showcase Canada and gradually showing the user UBC in this context. 

Improvements 
An improvement that could be made to the map is adding more attractions. Due to time constraints I was only able to add in a few of these attractions. However, if I were to take this project forward, I would add more attractions and possibly create menu tabs to separate ‘indoor’ and ‘outdoor’ attractions (so that students and tourists can easily make decisions based on the weather with the click of a button). Additionally, I would add low-cost restaurants and rest areas, to allow the viewer to plan for rest periods during their UBC tourism journey.
